# sp500-seasonal-analysis

This project analyzes the performance of the S&P 500 index throughout 2020 using Python and financial data from Yahoo Finance. It combines quantitative return calculations with dimensionality reduction and visual clustering to uncover seasonal patterns in market behavior. 

The objectives are as follows: 

Calculate the annual return of the S&P 500 index using daily closing prices.

Visualize monthly market behavior using PCA and scatter plots.

Identify temporal clusters that suggest seasonal trends or regime shifts.

The S&P 500 returned approximately 16% in 2020, recovering strongly after the March crash.

PCA-based scatter plots revealed distinct monthly clusters, indicating that market behavior shifts over time.

Later months (e.g., Octoberâ€“December) showed more dispersion, suggesting increased volatility or mixed sentiment.
